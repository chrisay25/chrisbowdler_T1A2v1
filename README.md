# Chris Bowdler Portfolio 

This is my Portfolio Website! https://6370af09524c8f1317e08511--capable-torrone-6ea4bb.netlify.app/

## Website 

[Chris Bowdler Portfolio] This is my first website I am developing as a new student Web developer at Coder Academy! The purpose of this webstite is to showcase my begining skill 
of how I create a website and to eventually look back in the future to see how far I have come in the coding world. The target audience of my website is future prospectable employers
who will watch my coding skills grow from the point I am at now. In this portfolio, i used many different html and CSS styles to complete the website. My skills with SCSS was not strong enough at this point and I just could not get it right in the time frame the assignment was due so at the last minute I decided to just do away with SCSS for now and just use plain CSS.

## Installation

I started first by creating ,y index.html page and entering the skelton code. I then made the about me blog and contact pages along with the skelton code to set the base of my website

## i then began to edit the pages

I began first with text on my pages, then starting to mess with some colors to get the perfect base that I wanted. I had trouble along the way with pictures not doing what I wanted,
then my github was playing up and I decided to start again on my windows desktop computer. I copied pages with the same base code, then edited them to suit the page that I was developing. I ftarted first with my social websites in the footer, this was the most simple part and later became a good helping hand with the header to get everything inline as I was having trouble with that on my pages.
<div class="Socials">

            <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">
                <img src="../images/Facebook01.png" alt="Facebook">
            </a>
 
            <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">
                <img src="../images/twitter01.png" alt="Twitter">
            </a>
 
            <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">
                <img src="../images/github01.png" alt="Github">
            </a>
 

        </div>
    
    Once I started using this code the webste started falling into place, all I had to do was align this up and create my fake text to finish off the website.
